How to create image redirects for {{link_icon}} at the Official Sunless Sea wiki:
- Better to do this *before* editing/creating pages that point to the images. Use Preview
- Find the target image name, such as:
	File:SS torpedosmall.png
- Use the full/canonical entity name as source, such as 'Torpedo Components'
	Remove ':', but leave spaces, dots, commas, apostrophes, etc, as is
- Paste the edit URL directly to browser address, for example:
	https://sunlesssea.gamepedia.com/File:SS Torpedo Components.png?action=edit
- Add the redirect content pointing to target:
	#REDIRECT [[File:SS torpedosmall.png]]

Copy & Paste helpers:

https://sunlesssea.gamepedia.com/File:SS .png?action=edit
#REDIRECT [[File:SS small.png]]
#REDIRECT [[File:SS gaz.png]]
